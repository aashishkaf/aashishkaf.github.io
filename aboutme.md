Hello! Thank you for coming here. My name is Aashish Kafle. I am first year graduate student in the Physics and Astroonomy department at Rice University, Houston TX. Originally from Kathmandu, Nepal, I have lived in Alabama for four years and am currently in Houston TX.

Apart from Physics, I enjoy hiking (more of a mindless strolling in the wild), reading continental philosophy authors, listening to music ranging from Hard Rock to Qawwali, and a lot of Folk music from all over the world, playing terrible guitar (I'm pretty good at this actually!), playing Ping-Pong...




### Why this blog

I wanted to have a blog to express my views and opinions about different matters. But as we grow, we change and our opinions change. So another reason for this blog is documenting the change that I go though over the years I live. And, also maybe give an outlook of me as a person and all that I value.
