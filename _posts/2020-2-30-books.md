There is something so thrilling about reading, and at the same time there is this painful fact that you can't read all there is to read. Here are some of the books that I have thoroughly enjoyed from the pool of what I have read.

*Crime and Punishment **Fyodor Dostoevsky**
*The Stranger **Albert Camus**
*The Picture of Dorian Gray **Oscar Wilde**
*Slaughterhouse-Five **Kurt Vonnegut**
*Notes from Underground **Fyodor Dostoevsky**
*Brothers Karamazov **Fyodor Dostoevsky**
*Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance **Robert M Pirsig**
*Siddhartha **Hermn Hesse**
*Beyond Good and Evil **Friedrich Nietzsche**
