SO Here I will talk about my state of mind regarding Manchester United.
For Now the big Thing is that we need HAALAND. Please Ole use your Norwegian connections and land him here.
And also, kinda feel bad of De Gea, but its true that sooner or letter we have to let him go. Can't forget all
the years where even though the team has been bad, he was the god-level player here
